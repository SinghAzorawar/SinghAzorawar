professional experience, I possess a strong foundation in SQL, PL/SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python. I'm a quick learner with a passion for
expanding my knowledge and skills. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to further develop my expertise and stay updated with the
latest industry trends. My proficiency in SQL and PL/SQL allows me to efficiently handle data and perform complex queries. I have
experience using Excel and Tableau to analyze and visualize data, making it accessible and actionable.
